# John's C# Drill Floor

## What is a Drill Floor?
In the Army National Guard, units are stationed in different towns and cities across America in buildings called Armories, instead of Forts and bases like the regular Army. In each of these buildings is a large gymnasium type room called the Drill Floor. This is the area where the unit meets as a whole and conducts most of their training (when not in the woods at least!).

This Repo is meant to be my training ground. I've been coding in C# since 2016, and have different notes, practice projects and code snippets all over the place. So, after listening to an episode of the Tim Corey podcast, I got the idea to create a single central repo that houses several solutions and projects for the different techniques and C# technologies that are out there - and to show case my knowledge in a clear and well organized manner.
